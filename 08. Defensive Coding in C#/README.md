# Defensive Coding in C#

Defensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:

- **General quality** – reducing the number of software bugs and problems.
- **Making the source code comprehensible** – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit.
- Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.  

**Clean Code**
- Easy to read
- Clear intent
- Simple
- Minimal
- Thoughtful

**Defensive Coding**
- Clean Code
- Testable Code + Unit Tests
- Validation + Exception Handling

**Clean, Testable, Predictable Methods**
- Clear Purpose
- Good Name
- Focused Code
- Short Length
- Automated Code Test

- Guard Clauses
- Minimize Number of Parameters
- Consistent Parameter Ordering

**Automated Code Tests**
- Structured
- Self-documented
- Automated
- Repeatable
- TARDS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space)

- AAA for Testing
  - Arrange
  - Act
  - Asser

**Key Considerations**
- Best Practices
- Clarity of Intent
- Predictability

**Use as for casting instead of blind cast**
