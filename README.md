# C# Full Course

**Each number is a complete course which contains sessions.**  
I needed to review C# from beginning to advanced and I thought it would be a good idea to record each session and share with other programmers, this repository contains courses projects.  
So you can find all sessions on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkI4Ml5iVZU&list=PLYhArLpz29AF8jyjGgMcDn-xgmjgwhJvg) or click on each item in below list to watch each session individually.  
**__This list will update every time I publish a new video on Youtube.__**
